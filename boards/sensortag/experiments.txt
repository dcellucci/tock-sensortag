Energy measurements

Disclaimer
----------

-- The debugger was used as power source to not drain the battery. 
   Using the debugger increases the power consumption with about 100 uA.

-- All values are +/- 30 uA depending on the contact between the cables and the Sensortag.

-- The multimeter used isn't the best one, only large changes in energy-consumption will be noticable. 

-- GPIO pins were configured to a low-power state before running the tests.

-- We have an offset of about 250 uA from where we should be according to the datasheet. Probably an external sensor that makes life hard for us.

Active                      4.1 mA
-----------------------------------

Sleep                       2.6 mA
-----------------------------------

Deep sleep                  2.1 mA   
-----------------------------------
+ CPU domain off            1.65 mA (~1590 uA)
+ VIMS disabled and PD off  1585 uA
+ Power Domains off         1455 uA (RFC, Serial, Peripheral) 
+ uLDO on                   1390 uA 
+ Switch to RCOSC           ~ Same  (Probably already using the RCOSC, otherwise 0.2 uA difference according to datasheet.
                                     Also needs to be run before AUX power down, current consumption through the roof otherwise)
+ AUX power down            1025 uA
+ DCDC on                   ~ Same 
+ Recharge config           850 uA  (Needs RTC sync or perhaps a delay?)      
+ Turn off dma/crypto/jtag  ~ Same  (Probably already disabled)
+ MCU RAM retention off     ~ Same  

+ MCU VD off                Increases from 0.2 mA up to 1.4 mA  (Probably means that we can't enter Shutdown mode properly or that we power on immediately)
